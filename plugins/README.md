# WIP

The plugins in this folder are entirely work-in-progress and are merely meant to show the design of plugins and/or the power of plugins. They will be used as examples when the final details are specified.

The latest documentation for plugins will be available at https://skeldjs.github.io/SkeldJS/modules/skeldjs.html.

To aid with plugin development, bare SkeldJS dummy server and client classes will be available to use in testing.
