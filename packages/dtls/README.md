## @skeldjs/dtls

ðŸ˜”

My sad, no-good implementation of the god-awful, disgusting, horrendous, hellspawn
of a dtls library https://github.com/willardf/Hazel-Networking/tree/master/Hazel/Dtls.

NEVER do I want to set foot into dtls territory again. Over 30 hours of grueling,
painful debugging.

Only does cipher suite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, feel free to add
it yourself, I personally will not. Ever.

Also only does curve x25519, which is perhaps the bane of my existence.

It should be secure, although I provide 0 guarantees and I refuse to check because
of how bad this is.

You can install it with `@skeldjs/dtls`, and it provides a `DtlsSocket` library.

Feel free to ruin the rest of my days with issues, if you encounter issues.
